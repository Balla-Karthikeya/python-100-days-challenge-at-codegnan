# file handling  - no data loss
# file operations - open, read, write, close
# file data storing - string-txt.file, tabular.csv(comma seperated value)file, hierarchical format(jsn(java script object notation) file)
# to open a file syntax
# file_object=open('file_name.txt', 'mode')
#          read/write operations
# file operating modes 
# r - reading content from file
# w - write content into file. It creates a new file if the file does not exist. When you open a file with 'w' mode, the file becomes empty. 
# a(append)- # add new content to previous mode


# r+ = read + write
# w+ =  write+ read
# a+ = write + read
